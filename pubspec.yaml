  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - images/profile.jpg
    - images/IMG_2690.jpg
    - images/1.jpg
    - images/2.jpg
    - images/3.jpg
    - images/4.jpg
    - images/5.jpg
    - images/6.jpg
    - images/7.jpg
    - images/8.jpg
    - images/9.jpg
    - images/10.jpg
    - images/11.jpg
    - images/12.jpg
    - images/13.jpg
    - images/14.jpg
    - images/15.jpg
    - images/16.jpg
    - images/17.jpg
    - images/18.jpg
    - images/19.jpg
    - images/20.jpg
    - images/21.jpg
    - images/22.jpg
    - images/23.jpg
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Pacifico
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Pacifico-Regular.ttf
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
